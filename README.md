# Next Steps in Python

<br><br>This is a series of Jupyter Notebooks, originally developed by Research Computing Services Lead Data Scientist Colby Witherup Wood (GitHub: agithasnoname) for the Lunch Lessons workshop series. Designed for Python coders who have completed the Python Fundamentals workshop series or a similar beginning Python tutorial, these individual lessons cover the coding skills that answer the question, “What should I learn next?” These topics explore the shortcuts and tools that aren’t usually covered in Python intro level workshops, but that are regularly used by intermediate and advanced Python coders. Answer keys are included.
<br><br>Each GitHub repo can be downloaded to open the notebooks on your own computer, or the notebooks can be opened in Google Colab and run on the cloud.


### <br><br>Notebooks and recording links for 2023-24 NSIP: Lunch Lessons
Links to notebooks will be posted here the morning before each Lunch Lesson. Links to recordings will be posted here in the afternoon after each Lunch Lesson; the password to view recordings will only be sent to registered participants.



### <br><br>Crucial skills for every Python coder 
These notebooks will teach you to write more efficient code.
- [List comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/listComprehension)
- [Combining strings and variables with fstrings](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/fstrings)
- [Saving and loading Python objects with pickle and json](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/pickleJson)

### Objects and functions every Python coder should recognize
These notebooks cover topics that you will encounter in other people's code.
- [Recognizing and indexing NumPy arrays](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/numpyArrays)
- [Lambda functions and when to use them](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/lambdas)
- [How to use functions with \*args and \*\*kwargs](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/argsKwargs)

### Specialized skills perfect for advanced beginning coders
If you frequently work with text strings or Pandas DataFrames:
- [Finding patterns in strings with built-in functions and the re package](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/stringPatterns)
- [Selecting and filtering data with Pandas loc, iloc, at, and iat](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/pandasLoc)

## To use the notebooks
There are two ways to access the materials:
1. On your own computer: If you have the Anaconda distribution of Python 3, you should have all the packages needed for these notebooks. Click on the green Code button above and choose Download ZIP. On your computer, open up Anaconda Navigator and choose either Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. Navigate to the folder you downloaded and open up the notebook of choice.
2. Online: Go to http://colab.research.google.com/. Choose GitHub from the orange menu. Search for NUITRCS/NextStepsInPython and select your notebook of choice.
