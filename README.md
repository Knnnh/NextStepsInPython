# Next Steps in Python

<br><br>This is a series of self-guided Jupyter Notebooks, originally developed by Research Computing Services Data Scientist Colby Witherup Wood (GitHub: agithasnoname) for the Lunch Lessons workshop series. Designed for Python coders who have completed the Python Fundamentals workshop series or a similar beginning Python tutorial, these individual lessons cover the coding skills that answer the question, “What should I learn next?” These topics explore the shortcuts and tools that aren’t usually covered in Python intro level workshops, but that are regularly used by intermediate and advanced Python coders.

### Crucial skills for every Python coder 
These notebooks will teach you to write more efficient code.
- List comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions
- Combining strings and variables with fstrings
- Saving and loading Python objects with pickle and json

### Objects and functions every Python coder should recognize
These notebooks cover topics that you will encounter in other people's code.
- Recognizing and indexing Numpy arrays
- Lambda functions and when to use them
- How to use functions with *args and **kwargs

### Specialized skills perfect for advanced beginning coders
If you frequently work with text strings or pandas DataFrames:
- Finding patterns in strings with built-in functions and the re package
- Selecting and filtering data with pandas loc, iloc, at, and iat
