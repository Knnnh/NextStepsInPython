# Next Steps in Python

<br><br>This is a series of self-guided Jupyter Notebooks, originally developed by Research Computing Services Data Scientist Colby Witherup Wood (GitHub: agithasnoname) for the Lunch Lessons workshop series. Designed for Python coders who have completed the Python Fundamentals workshop series or a similar beginning Python tutorial, these individual lessons cover the coding skills that answer the question, “What should I learn next?” These topics explore the shortcuts and tools that aren’t usually covered in Python intro level workshops, but that are regularly used by intermediate and advanced Python coders.

### Crucial skills for every Python coder 
These notebooks will teach you to write more efficient code.
- [List comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/listComprehension)
- [Combining strings and variables with fstrings](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/fstrings)
- [Saving and loading Python objects with pickle and json](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/pickleJson)

### Objects and functions every Python coder should recognize
These notebooks cover topics that you will encounter in other people's code.
- [Recognizing and indexing NumPy arrays](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/numpyArrays)
- [Lambda functions and when to use them](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/lambdas)
- [How to use functions with \*args and \*\*kwargs](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/argsKwargs)

### Specialized skills perfect for advanced beginning coders
If you frequently work with text strings or Pandas DataFrames:
- [Finding patterns in strings with built-in functions and the re package](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/stringPatterns)
- [Selecting and filtering data with Pandas loc, iloc, at, and iat](https://github.com/nuitrcs/NextStepsInPython/tree/master/pandasLoc)
